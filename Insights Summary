📊 E-Commerce Analytics Project — Insights Summary

This project analyzes a simulated e-commerce dataset containing:

40,000+ orders

100,000+ line items

5,000 customers

600+ products

9 relational tables

The objective is to practice SQL and derive meaningful business insights.

⭐ 1. Revenue & Customer KPIs

Total Revenue: Derived from all order items multiplied by unit price.

Total Orders: 40K+ orders across multiple years.

Total Customers: ~5K unique buyers.

Insight: Revenue is heavily concentrated among a smaller subset of repeat buyers, which suggests that retention and loyalty programs would yield high ROI.

📅 2. Monthly Revenue Trends

Revenue displays consistent seasonality.

Clear peaks occur during holiday months (Nov–Dec).

Slower periods appear mid-year.

Insight: Marketing spend should be shifted toward Q4, with experimentation in offseason months.

🛒 3. Top Customers

The top 10 customers contribute disproportionately to total revenue.

Many consistently purchase high-value products.

Insight: Personalized outreach (discounts, early access, loyalty rewards) could significantly boost LTV.

📦 4. Product & Category Performance

A small set of products drive the majority of revenue.

Certain categories consistently outperform others.

Insight: Prioritizing inventory and advertising toward these high-performers is recommended.

🔄 5. Returns Behavior

Return rates differ significantly by category.

Electronics and apparel categories show higher return percentages.

Certain return reasons cluster around specific suppliers.

Insight:
Addressing quality issues or setting better expectations on sizing/specs could reduce returns.

🚚 6. Shipping Efficiency

Delivery times vary across carriers.

Some carriers consistently deliver faster but at higher shipping cost.

Insight:
Optimize shipping partners by balancing speed vs. cost per region.

💙 7. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

High-LTV customers tend to reorder in cycles.

Most revenue comes from repeat customers, not one-time buyers.

Insight:
Retention strategies (emails, bundles, subscriptions) would likely improve profitability.
